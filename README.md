# CS-437-Deep-Learning

Projects completed during Deep Learning course taken at Lahore University of Management Sciences.

###Sentiment Analysis: 
Trained 3 types of models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, <10000 parems) to understand positive and negative tone in sentences. Each model was trained using 50000 IMDB movie reviews which were cleaned and prepared for analysis. It was split into a 70:30 train:test batches randomly. All 3 models achieved +80% accuracy as was confirmed using an independent 10 reviews at the end.

###Generative Adverserial Network(GAN): 
Used Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network to generate emojis out of noise.

###Cross-View Image Retrieval: 
Created system to match satellite view images of mountains, stadiums, freeways, rivers, ships and palaces with their street view images. System was made up of three components: Feature extraction by fine tuning a VGG16 model, Similarity matching of feature vectors extracted and image retrieval based on similarity score.
